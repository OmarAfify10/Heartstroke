# Name of the Project :Heartstroke ( Desicion Tree)
In this Project we were working with health data that shows wether a heartstroke occured or not . we created a model which can predict the Heartstroke through the other available factors .

Execution 
To run this Jupyter Notebook , use the binder link above .Open the notebook Heartstroke.ipynb. Then run each line from the top to the bottom.

Results:
Heat stroke prediction leverages advanced data analytics and machine learning to identify early signs of heat-related illnesses. By monitoring individual physiological data, predictive models can provide timely warnings to prevent heat strokes. This proactive approach enhances safety and well-being.
