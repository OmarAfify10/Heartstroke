# Execution 
To run this Jupyter Notebook , use the binder link above .Open the notebook Heartstroke.ipynb. Then run each line from the top to the bottom.

# Results:
After running the desicion Tree Model and random forest Model ,we see an overall accuracy 0.86 for Desicion Tree and 0.85 for Random forest . Desicion Tree has also better results in the confusion matrix .
